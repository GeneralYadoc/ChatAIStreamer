## How to use
- [OpenAI API Key](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/) is necessary.

- You can use ChatAIStreamer class by implementing 'Add Implement' blocks of following codes.
  ``` example
  import sys
  import ChatAIStreamer as casr # Import this

  class myVoiceGenerator(casr.voiceGenerator):
    def generate(self, text):
      optimized_text = None
      voice = None

      #### Add Implementation here.
      # Optimize text for your TTS and assign to optimized_text variable.
      # Generate voice from optimized_text and assign to voice variable.
      # There is no restriction of the type of the voice.
      ####

      return optimized_text, voice

  # callback for getting answer of ChatGPT
  # The voice generated by voiceGenerator is given as an argument.
  def answer_cb(user_message, completion, voice):
    #### Add Implementation here.
    # Implement for visualizing message (given as user_message).
    # Implement for visualizing ChatGPT answer (given as completion).
    # Implement for playing voice generated myVoiceGenerator.
    ####

  running = False

  # YouTube Video ID and ChatGPT API Key is given from command line in this example.
  if len(sys.argv) <= 2:
    exit(0)

  # Set params of getting messages from stream source.
  stream_params=casr.streamParams(video_id=sys.argv[1])

  # Set params of Chat AI.
  ai_params=casr.aiParams(
    api_key = sys.argv[2],
    system_role = "You are a cheerful assistant who speek English and can get conversation exciting with user.",
    answer_cb = answer_cb
  )

  # Create ChatAIStreamer instance.
  ai_streamer =casr.ChatAIStreamer(
    casr.params(stream_params=stream_params, ai_params=ai_params, voice_generator=myVoiceGenerator())
  )

  running = True

  # Wake up internal thread to get chat messages from stream and play voices of reading ChatGPT answers aloud.
  ai_streamer.start()

  # Wait any key inputted from keyboad.
  input()

  # Turn off runnging flag in order to finish playing voices of the sample.
  running=False

  # Finish generating voices.
  # Internal thread will stop soon.
  ai_streamer.disconnect()

  # terminating internal thread.
  ai_streamer.join()

  del ai_streamer

  ```

## GttsAIStreamer - sample wrapper of ChatAIStreamer
- Sample class named [GttsAIStreamer](src/GttsAIStreamer.py) is provided with which you can play ChatGPT answers by gTTS voice.
- You can get gTTS voice and play it by the class.
- Sample codes using GttsAIStreamer exist [here](samples/sample.py).
  ``` sample.py
  # To execute this sample, please install ffmpeg.
  import sys
  import time
  import math
  import datetime
  import GttsAIStreamer as gasr

  # print sentence by a character incrementally.
  def print_incremental(st, interval_sec):
    for i in range(len(st)):
      if not running:
        break
      print(f"{st[i]}", end='')
      sys.stdout.flush()
      interruptible_sleep(interval_sec)

  # Customized sleep for making available of running flag interruption.
  def interruptible_sleep(time_sec):
    counter = math.floor(time_sec / 0.01)
    frac = time_sec - (counter * 0.01)
    for i in range(counter):
      if not running:
        break
      time.sleep(0.01)
    if not running:
      return
    time.sleep(frac)

  # callback for getting answer of ChatGPT
  # The voice generated by GttsGenerator is given.
  def answer_cb(user_message, completion, voice):
    print(f"\n[{user_message.extern.author.name} {user_message.extern.datetime}] {user_message.message}\n")
    time_str = datetime.datetime.now().strftime ('%H:%M:%S')
    message = completion.choices[0]["message"]["content"]

    # Play the voice by VoicePlayer of GttsAIStreamer
    player = gasr.VoicePlayer(voice)
    player.start()

    interruptible_sleep(3)
    print(f"[ChatGPT {time_str}] ", end='')
    print_incremental(message, 0.05)
    print("\n")

    # Wait finishing Playng the voice.
    player.join()

  running = False

  # YouTube Video ID and ChatGPT API Key is given from command line in this example.
  if len(sys.argv) <= 2:

    system_role = "You are a cheerful assistant who speek English and can get conversation exciting with user.",
    answer_cb = answer_cb
  )

  # Create GttsVoiceGenerator
  # You can choose other language by its 'lang=' argument like 'ja'.
  # If you want to change language, Please change the assignment for system role of ai params also.
  # The instance isn't necessary for English generator.
  voice_generator=gasr.GttsGenerator(lang='en')

  # Create GttsAIStream instance.
  # 'voice_generator=' is omittable for English generator.
  ai_streamer =gasr.GttsAIStreamer(
    gasr.params(stream_params=stream_params, ai_params=ai_params, voice_generator=voice_generator)
  )

  running = True

  # Wake up internal thread to get chat messages from stream and play gTTS voices of reading ChatGPT answers aloud.
  ai_streamer.start()

  # Wait any key inputted from keyboad.
  input()

  # Turn off runnging flag in order to finish playing gTTS voices of the sample.
  running=False

  # Finish generating gTTS voices.
  # Internal thread will stop soon.
  ai_streamer.disconnect()

  # terminating internal thread.
  ai_streamer.join()

  del ai_streamer
  ```

### Notice
- Please refer [pytchat README](https://github.com/taizan-hokuto/pytchat) to know the type of YouTube Chat item used by get_item_cb, pre_filter_cb and post filter_cb.
- Stamps in a message and messages consisted by stamps only are removed defaultly even if user doesn't set pre_filter_cb.
- Default value of interval_sec is 20.0, since free user of OpenAI API can get only 3 completions per minitue.
- The system role given by user remains ever as the oldest sentence of current context even if the number of messages is reached to the maximum, so ChatGPT doesn't forgot the role while current cunversation.
